That's the benefit of a library, we can get methods that do not come out of the box with Python.  So we use the `read_excel` data to read our excel file, by providing the name of the file, `cities.xlsx`, and the preceding `./` just indicates that the file is found in the current folder.  Finally with the line `travel_df.to_dict('records')` we return a list of our dictionaries representing our data.  You can see that when we access the first element of this list, it returns our first dictionary.  "
